             <p style="font-size: 37px;">Virat not only sharpens his batting skills, but too works on all the related dimensions that supplements his performance on field, be it fitness, maintaining lean body, health, how to improvise, strong bottom hand muscles, bat-mind connection, etc. We should also try to improve in the core as well as in the related areas too so that there would be no void left.</p>

             <p style="font-size: 37px;">Virat didn't even complete his 12th, but when we listen him in a formal interview , he seems like a proper well educated elite. His speaking style, his defending answers were on par with the proffesionals. Eloquency embellishes ones personality and it helps us to grow in every profession.</p>

             <p style="font-size: 37px;">There is hairline difference between controlled aggression and over-aggression. Controlled aggression boosts performance and prevents from submission. While over-aggression undermines the personality, and deteriorates our performance. Virat shows a true example of Controlled aggression. He is one who takes help of controlled aggression to boost his and his teamâ€™s performance, without crossing the limit. We should learn this quality from him.</p>

             <p style="font-size: 30px;">A 23 year old young talent, on the Tour of Australia with the Indian Cricket team, showing a middle finger to the unruly SCG( Sydney Cricket ground).<br> And this is the same prolific cricketer, who is now a swashbuckling star breaking batting records and the Indian Cricket Captain on all formats. <br> In one of his matches in the recent Cricket World Cup 2019, in a game against Australia, he saw the crowd was booing Steve Smith on his return after completing the 1 year ban because of Ball Tampering charges. The crowd called him a <i>cheater</i>. Virat, on seeing this, signals to the crowd to stop shouting and cheer him as he has returned after a long break.<br><br><b>With time and responsibilities, the young aggressive bundle of energy, has turned into a gentleman and a sportsperson in true spirits.</b></p>
